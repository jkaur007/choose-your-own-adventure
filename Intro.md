# The Lost Relic of Eldoria

You are standing at the edge of an ancient forest, holding a **weathered map**. Legends whisper about the **Lost Relic of Eldoria**, hidden deep in the **Forgotten Ruins**. It is said that whoever finds it will wield unimaginable power. But the path is dangerous.  

As you take a deep breath, you face three choices:  

1. **Enter the Dark Forest** – A quick but perilous route. [Go to the Dark Forest.](dark-forest.md)  
2. **Follow the River** – A slower but possibly safer journey. [Take the River Path.](river-path.md)  
3. **Seek guidance from the Village Elder** – Perhaps wisdom can help. [Visit the Elder.](village-elder.md)
