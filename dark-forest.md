# The Dark Forest

You step into the **Dark Forest**, where twisted trees cast eerie shadows. The deeper you go, the more unnatural the silence becomes. Suddenly, a soft glow catches your eye—**a cluster of glowing mushrooms**.

Do you:  
1. **Follow the glowing mushrooms** – Maybe they lead somewhere. [Go to the Mushroom Path.](mushroom-path.md)  
2. **Cross a mysterious foggy bridge** – Suspicious, but it might be the fastest route. [Go to the Foggy Bridge.](foggy-bridge.md)
