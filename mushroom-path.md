# The Glowing Mushrooms

You step onto the glowing path, and suddenly, a deep voice rumbles:  
*"You have chosen wisely, seeker of the relic. But wisdom is tested in riddles."*  

A mystical stone appears with a riddle:  

*"I have keys but open no locks, I have space but no room. What am I?"*  

Do you:  
1. **Answer "A keyboard"** – [See what happens.](relic-chamber.md)  
2. **Answer incorrectly** – [Face the Guardian’s Wrath.](guardian.md)
