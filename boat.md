# The Mysterious Boat

You untie the boat and step inside. As soon as you sit down, the current picks up, carrying you downstream. The mist thickens, and strange whispers seem to float in the air.

Suddenly, a glowing figure emerges from the mist—a **guardian of the river**, watching you intently.

Do you:

- **Speak to the Guardian and seek guidance?** → [guardian.md](guardian.md)
- **Stay silent and let the river guide you further?** → [river-path.md](river-path.md)
