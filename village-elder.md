# The Village Elder

The old village elder listens carefully as you describe your quest.  
*"The relic is powerful, but many have perished seeking it,"* he warns.  

Do you:  
1. **Accept his guidance** – [Gain a secret advantage.](foggy-bridge.md)  
2. **Ignore his warning and leave immediately** – [Head straight to danger.](guardian.md)
