# The River Path

You follow the winding path along the river, its waters glowing faintly under the moonlight. The air is thick with mist, and the sound of flowing water fills your ears.

As you walk, you spot a **small wooden boat** tied to a rock. A faint shimmer surrounds it, as if it's waiting for you.

Do you:

- **Take the boat and follow the river's flow?** → [boat.md](boat.md)
- **Look around and call out for help?** → [guardian.md](guardian.md)
