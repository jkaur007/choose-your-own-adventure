# The River Guardian

A spectral figure, glowing with a soft blue light, hovers above the river. Its voice is deep and echoing.

"You who seek passage," it intones, "must prove your wisdom."

The Guardian presents you with a riddle:

*"I consume all, yet I am not alive. The more you feed me, the bigger I grow. What am I?"*

Do you:

- **Answer "Fire" with confidence?** → [boat.md](boat.md)
- **Stay silent and let the Guardian decide your fate?** → [river-path.md](river-path.md)
