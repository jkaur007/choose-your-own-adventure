# The Foggy Bridge

You step onto the bridge, but halfway across, a figure emerges from the mist.  
*"Turn back now, or face the curse!"* it warns.  

Do you:  
1. **Ignore the warning and rush forward** – [Face the Curse.](cursed-ending.md)  
2. **Try to reason with the figure** – [Gain the figure’s trust.](ally.md)
