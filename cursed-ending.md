# The Curse Awakens

Ignoring the warning, you charge forward. Suddenly, the bridge **collapses**, and you **fall into darkness**.  

You wake up... but **something is different**. You are no longer human. The **curse has transformed you into a shadow**, forever guarding the ruins.  

ğŸ’€ **Your adventure ends in eternal darkness.**
